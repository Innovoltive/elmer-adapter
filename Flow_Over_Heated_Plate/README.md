# Example Problem: Partitioned heat conduction

Refer to [flow-over-heated-plate](https://precice.org/tutorials-flow-over-heated-plate.html) for a detailed explanation of the case.

## Contents of this folder

* `precice-config.xml`: A preCICE configuration for explicit coupling.
* `README.md`: The file you are currently reading
* Five folders (`Reference_Problem/`, `Fluid-elmer/`,`Fluid-openfoam/`, `Solid-elmer` and `Solid-openfoam` ):
    * `case.sif`: This is the system input file generated by ElmerGUI (or written by hand), to be fed to `ElmerSolver` together with the mesh files to run the simulation.

## Running the Reference example

The example is provided in three different versions: A reference case, where the problem is solved monolithically and a coupled case, where each domain can be solved by Elmer or OpenFoam. For all three cases the same steps must be executed.
1. Go To `Reference_Problem/`
2. Run the simulation  `ElmerSolver case.sif`. For the monolithic case you only need to run a single processes. 
5. Visualize results: results are stored in the results folder (`out`) and may be visualized using Paraview.

**Hint** the location of the output results can be modified in `.sif` file in the `Header` section.

## Running the Coupled simulation for Elmer-Elmer coupling

This scenario uses two independent Elmer simulations. One for the Dirichlet participant, one for the Neumann participant. Follow the steps above for `Fluid-elmer` and `Solid-Elmer`.

1. Open two terminals (or use tmux) and cd to each of the folders.
2. Run the simulation  `ElmerSolver case.sif` in each folder. Make sure there is no precice-run folder in the parent flder. This will cause issues, sometimes.  
3. Visualize results: results are stored in the results folder (`out`) and may be visualized using Paraview.

**Hint** To compare the results with the reference problem, open both vtk files in the out folder and use the `Group Datasets` in Paraview filters
